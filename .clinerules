# Rules for cline

## Memory Bank

Read @/.memory_bank.md to set up Memory Bank for this project.
Regardless of the memory bank state, you must always respect the rules
in the following sections in this document.

## Rules of Engagement

* When you are caught in a loop, suspend the on-going task and raise
  your hand early, so that I can break the complex task down into steps
  before spending tokens.
* Consider splitting source files when a production source file reaches
  980 lines or when a test source file reaches 480 lines.  Avoid each
  reaches 1000 lines and 500 lines respectively.

## Documentation

When modifying any implementation, update the `README.md` document,
manual pages, and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the changes.

## Text file standards

* Use "Typewriter spacing" style (two spaces after full stop) except
  for manual pages.  If such a full stop character appears at the end
  of a line, this is not applied.
* Prefer British spelling over American spelling except for proper
  nouns.
* Lines should be wrapped at 72 characters (never exceed 72 characters
  unless the line is preformatted).  Trailing punctuation may appear
  after the 72-character limit if necessary.

### Special notes for Markdown formatting

These rules should be always respected for markdown files:

* Headings should be surrounded by blank lines (MD022)
* Lists should be surrounded by blank lines (MD032)
