# Product Context: ID3Tag

## Problem Space

Digital audio files often lack consistent, manageable metadata.
Developers and music enthusiasts need a reliable way to:

- Extract accurate metadata from audio files.
- Validate and standardize tag information.
- Manage large collections of audio files efficiently.

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers

- Simple, intuitive API (focused on ID3v1 reading).
- Minimal setup required.
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Predictable behaviour across different file types.

### For End Users

- Reliable metadata extraction for ID3v1 tags.
- Quick batch processing.
- Preservation of original file integrity.
- Minimal but good and enough described usage document.

## Key User Stories

1. As a music library manager, I want to make sure multiple audio files
   have ID3v1 tags.
2. As a developer, I want to:
   - Integrate ID3 tag management into my application.
   - Perform bulk metadata operations with minimal code complexity.

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Music Library Management

- User has a large MP3/FLAC collection with inconsistent metadata
  (ID3v1 tags missing or incorrect).
- Wants to know files that lack ID3v1 tags.

## Value Proposition

- Simplify metadata management for audio files (ID3v1 tags).
- Reduce manual effort in organizing digital music collections.
